# ICD-App
ICD-10 for your application.

This small project consists of the ICD-10 as a CVS file and a PHP script that takes that file and creates an array. You can use this array in your application, for example, to create a SQL table.

When oppening the CVS file, the colums but be separeted by the "$" caracter.
